# Academic_Collaboration-Graph
# Academic Collaboration Graph Project

## Description
This project models collaboration relationships between authors using a graph-based system. Authors are represented as nodes, and co-authorship relationships are represented as weighted edges. The system includes features like shortest path calculation, BFS, and BST construction. The project also provides an interactive graph visualization with zoom, node highlighting, and dynamic updates based on user input.

## Features
- **Graph-Based System**: Authors are represented as nodes, and co-authorship relationships are represented as weighted edges.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implemented algorithms include shortest path, breadth-first search (BFS), and binary search tree (BST) construction.
- **Interactive Visualization**: The graph is visualized with interactive features, including zoom, node highlighting, and dynamic updates.
- **Data Processing**: The project processes an Excel dataset to extract author and co-authorship information, assigning unique IDs to each author.
- **User Interface**: A user interface is provided to display graph analysis results, including shortest paths, collaboration counts, and longest paths.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python (or another preferred language)
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Queues, Binary Search Trees (BST)
- **Data Formats**: Excel, JSON (for optional extensions)
- **Visualization**: Interactive graph visualization (e.g., using libraries like NetworkX or Matplotlib)
